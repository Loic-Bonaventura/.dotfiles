[David Programa] decided this was too easy, and instead developed a system to allow him <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jm95aeSz9Fg" target="_blank">to pedal his way around the virtual world.</a></p>
<p>The device relies on a flywheel-based exercise bike, with six magnets placed on the flywheel that triggers a reed switch six times per rotation. The extra magnets give the system better resolution at slow speeds. A Hall Effect sensor would be a more reliable way to build this to survive in the long term, but the reed switch does work. It&#8217;s paired with a debounce circuit to keep the output clean.Â A Raspberry Pi is pressed into service, running a Python program to read a GPIO pin activated by the reed switch, counting pulses to determine the speed of pedalling.</p>
<p>The trigger control used in the Xbox 360 controller is a potentiometer that creates varying voltages depending on its position, allowing it to act as an analog accelerator input. 0 volts corresponds to no input, while the trigger reads 3.3 volts when fully depressed. The Raspberry Pi emulates this with its PWM output, paired with a low-pass filter to create the relevant voltage to inject into the trigger input on a generic Xbox 360 controller.</p>
<p>While it&#8217;s a lot less practical than simply using a regular controller, the pedal controls do allow you to get a great workout while playing Grand Theft Auto. Some of the more intense chase missions should be a great way to get your heart rate up, and that&#8217;s got to be a good thing.</p>
<p>Ironically, though, the system only works for cars and motorbikes in game. The bicycles in Grand Theft Auto are controlled by mashing the A button instead. Alternatively, you might consider a similar system for <a href="https://hackaday.com/2021/02/08/this-joy-con-grip-steers-to-its-way-to-sweaty-victory/#more-460332">playing Mario Kart on the Nintendo Switch</a>.
