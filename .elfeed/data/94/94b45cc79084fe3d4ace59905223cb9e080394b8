By definition, we make things. Some of us prefer to build from scraps, while others like to make their own IC&#8217;s in their garage. [Make With Miles] on the other hand prefers one of the oldest types of making around: woodworking. And in this build, he goes a step further by using a very old Japanese method of woodworking called Kumiko to build a Stratocaster style electric guitar. The results are absolutely stunning <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U5r_PE2OznM" target="_blank">as you can see in the video below</a>.</p>
<p>Inspired by a challenge put forth by [<a href="https://www.stitcher.com/show/the-modern-maker-podcast" target="_blank">The Modern Maker Podcast</a>] to build a woodworking project that ties into another hobby that isn&#8217;t related to woodworking, [Miles] knocked it out of the park by including several art forms in this one-off Strat.</p>
<p>The centerpiece of this guitar build is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kumiko_(woodworking)" target="_blank">Kumiko</a> style of construction used within the body. Kumiko is a Japanese method of assembling wood without the use of fasteners. Developed around 600-700AD, Kumiko is as much a construction method as an art form. [Miles] went further by filling the Kumiko framework with blackened epoxy resin which was then sanded and polished. Decals bring the headstock into the motif, but the attention to details goes much, much further. Be sure to watch the video so you can get an appreciation for the high level of workmanship that this young man displays.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s right- [Miles] isn&#8217;t a maker with decades of experience. In fact in 2017, one of his YouTube videos was &#8220;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBBnSBIv2cs" target="_blank">12 yr Old Builds a Row Boat!!!</a>&#8221; [Miles], our hats are off to you and we look forward to seeing your art progress, for you truly have commanded the attention of the maker community that you are so rightfully part of.</p>
<p>Just as [Miles]&#8217; guitar hides some great hacks, so does this <a href="https://hackaday.com/2021/05/11/guitar-with-hot-swappable-pickups-lights-our-fire/">guitar with Hot Swappable pickups</a>. Thanks to [Keith] for sending this on to the <a href="https://hackaday.com/submit-a-tip/">Tip Line</a>!</p>
