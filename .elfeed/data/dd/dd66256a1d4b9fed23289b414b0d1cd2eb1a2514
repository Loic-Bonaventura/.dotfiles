<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey all,</p> <p>it&#39;s been a few months since I 100% switched to Linux and it&#39;s been real great. Already been used to using Mint on my laptop, but decided I&#39;d wanna try Manjaro as my first Desktop OS.</p> <p>Performance was buttery smooth, even for some Wine programs that would run even better than on Windows, and no problem with missing proprietary software, except for the NVIDIA driver which I tried to ignore, but it all worked out.</p> <p>After a bit, I wanted to try and toy around with a standalone Window Manager (not daily driving, just merely testing stuff out). I have a pretty nice awesome+polybar setup with picom and PipeWire (instead of PulseAudio for Manjaro), and I got used to the controls fairly quickly, but there&#39;s one small problem:</p> <p>On Manjaro (using KDE), I was getting notably way higher frames on most of my games (Wine/Lutris or not), and less latency on my tablet driver (OpenTabletDriver). Are there some kind of optimizations that Manjaro or KDE/DEs are doing to help with games? Or perhaps my audio setup being scuffed and lagging the games that would depend on it?</p> <p>This might not be the right place to ask about this sort of stuff so if you also have suggestions to where I should ask please tell me.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/xTrM_"> /u/xTrM_ </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DistroTube/comments/safia8/wm_optimizations_vs_prebuilt_des/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DistroTube/comments/safia8/wm_optimizations_vs_prebuilt_des/">[comments]</a></span>
