<p><p>The free and open source game manager Lutris continues expanding the stores it supports installing games from, with Origin now being added into the mix. Currently Lutris supports installing games (both native Linux builds and Windows games with Wine) for Humble Bundle, GOG, Steam, Epic Games and Emulators so adding Origin sounds like a good idea.</p>

<p>No new release is actually out with it yet, as the code has just been added into the current development area on <a href="https://github.com/lutris/lutris" target="_blank">GitHub</a>. Lead dev Mathieu Comandon teased it on <a href="https://twitter.com/MComandon/status/1485207577193431040/photo/1" target="_blank">Twitter</a>: "Origin integration for Lutris is now available on the development branch!".</p>
