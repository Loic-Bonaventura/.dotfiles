<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>&#x200B;</p> <p>I have org files with lots of sections of all sorts (markdown, plain text, code, calculations, directory trees, etc., etc.), some of them within babel #+begin and #+end delimiters, some not. All these sections have some implicit foldable structure. Some have exisiting appropriate language modes, some do not.</p> <p>My question is, in coding up custom folding commands for these sections, should I try and base the commands on extending the folding functions provided by org-mode, or should I choose my preferred folding library (of which there are many) and extend it, potentially clashing with org-mode in some way?</p> <p>I think I like stateful/persistent folding as in &quot;vimish-fold&quot;. I prefer staying within the org-mode buffer rather escaping to a dedicated buffer and returning.</p> <p>Any pointers to discussions much appreciated.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/antoinedestexupery"> /u/antoinedestexupery </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/scdh51/extending_folding_in_orgbabel/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/scdh51/extending_folding_in_orgbabel/">[comments]</a></span>
