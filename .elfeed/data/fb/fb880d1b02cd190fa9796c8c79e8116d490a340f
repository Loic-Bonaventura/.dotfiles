<p><p>Point and click adventure fans will be happy as the complete The Blackwell Bundle is now supported on Linux.</p>

<p>Wadjet Eye Games went back and upgraded all entries in the series to either upgrade the existing version and fix Linux issues, re-add Linux support or add new Linux support. On top of that, each game in the series also had an update to fix other reported issues.</p>

<p>"In the Blackwell Legacy, you are introduced to Rosangela as she meets Joey Mallone for the first time and is called upon to investigate a series of mysterious suicides at a local university. An enigmatic killer and a string of seemingly unconnected accidents set the background for Blackwell Unbound. Blackwell Convergence will have you investigating a film premiere that hides a bloody past. In Blackwell Deception youâ€™ll investigate why the customers of various street psychics seem to die under very mysterious circumstances. And finally, in Blackwell Epiphany, you will find out the true reason why Rosa became a medium, and her ultimate destiny."</p>
