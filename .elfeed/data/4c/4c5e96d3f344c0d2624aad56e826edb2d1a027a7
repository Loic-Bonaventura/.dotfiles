<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello Reddit Emacs community. I just wanted to share tb-keycast global minor mode. Might be useful for someone who stream/record Emacs videos.</p> <p><a href="https://github.com/ir33k/tb-keycast">https://github.com/ir33k/tb-keycast</a></p> <p>Created as alternative to keycast package that does the same thing in mode-line. I was trying this original package but found that it doesn&#39;t behave exactly like I wanted so I created my own from scratch.</p> <p>Originally it was also integrated with mode-line but since I&#39;m on newer Emacs version I took the opportunity to move it to tab-bar. I think it&#39;s much better that way.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/ir33k"> /u/ir33k </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/sd4olv/emacs_281_tabbar_keycast_global_minor_mode/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/sd4olv/emacs_281_tabbar_keycast_global_minor_mode/">[comments]</a></span>
