<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>All I did was ask for ddr2 that was better than 2 gig so I could host another Minecraft instance. I got laughed off Facebook for asking for old memory. Then at work someone I barely know said he was bringing it in the next day and I thought . . . Did he just say 64 gigs?</p> <p>Does anyone know what I can do to fill 64 gigs of ram that is mildly entertaining or better? I don&#39;t think Zabbix and another Minecraft server will even make it break a sweat.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/cleuseau"> /u/cleuseau </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/sdn2vv/buddy_just_donated_a_i7_with_64_gigs_of_ram_for/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/sdn2vv/buddy_just_donated_a_i7_with_64_gigs_of_ram_for/">[comments]</a></span>
