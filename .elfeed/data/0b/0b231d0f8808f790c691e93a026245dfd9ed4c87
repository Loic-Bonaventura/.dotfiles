<img typeof="foaf:Image" src="https://opensource.com/sites/default/files/lead-images/code_development_programming.png" width="520" height="292" alt="Developing code." title="Developing code." /><p>I like the <a href="http://www.groovy-lang.org/" target="_blank">Groovy programming language</a> a lot. I like it because, in the end, I like Java, even though Java sometimes feels clumsy. And because I like Java so much, I don't find many other JVM languages especially attractive. Kotlin, Scala, and Clojure, for example, don't feel much like Java, pursuing their own perspectives on what makes a good programming language.</p>
