<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m wanting to get into a more minimal setup and possibly switch to a window manager, rather than a DE. I&#39;ve searched in every way I know how to find a launcher that can be customized, but that has both a text field to launch/search apps by name, but also includes menus. My memory is rather terrible and my mind slips easily so I sometimes can&#39;t remember the name of an app I&#39;m looking for, or forget what I was doing by the time I open my menu (whisker currently) so a browsable menu would make a world of difference for me. Any suggestions?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/JanusZeal304"> /u/JanusZeal304 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DistroTube/comments/s349lo/looking_for_a_different_app_launcher/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DistroTube/comments/s349lo/looking_for_a_different_app_launcher/">[comments]</a></span>
