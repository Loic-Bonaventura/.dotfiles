<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>As react is now the most popular FE framework by a mile (and I and countless others work in it daily), it drives me crazy there&#39;s no major-mode for it. I&#39;ve done a ton of googling and tried a lot of solutions people put online, and I did have some that worked decently well, but none are perfect and the one I was just using broke after an update (like many I&#39;ve tried before have). I feel like the best solution would be to just write a major-mode for it, it would help keep a lot of web devs on emacs who like the extensibility but are frustrated by the amount of work it takes to just get jsx/tsx to be supported like they are in every other major editor (maybe vim aside, I never use it so I can&#39;t say).</p> <p>I have some basic emacs experience, I&#39;ve been using it daily for about 3 years and have fiddled around with some packages and gone through elisp tutorials and even built some dumb programs to play around (like a tic-tac-toe game), but I honestly don&#39;t know the first thing about writing a major mode, and while I&#39;ve read some tutorials on doing so I know people who have experience doing this have a much better idea of what would need to be done, how to break down the work required, and what modern tools (thinking treesitter) could be used to make the syntax parsing, etc much easier.</p> <p>I do work full time and am also doing my MBA, but I&#39;d be more than happy to dedicate a night or two a week to get this moving. Unless there&#39;s something else out there or someone has started on something, I&#39;d be more than happy to contribute, I just need some guidance on getting up to speed on everything required for a fully-functional major mode. Hopefully this isn&#39;t some pipe dream, I feel like with tree-sitter and lsp (and the foundational work already done for other js modes) we could come up with something really solid. Let me know your thoughts, appreciated!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/tangled_up_in_blue"> /u/tangled_up_in_blue </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/sbxjer/really_sick_of_the_shoddy_jsxtsx_handlingwould/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/sbxjer/really_sick_of_the_shoddy_jsxtsx_handlingwould/">[comments]</a></span>
