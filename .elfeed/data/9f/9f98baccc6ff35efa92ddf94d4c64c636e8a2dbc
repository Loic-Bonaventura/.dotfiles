<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Often the images that I link into an org file are huge and I need to resize them each time (with the interactive function image-decrease-size). It would be quite helpful whenever I open an org file and all the images are displayed to have them automatically adjusted to the screen size. Is that possible somehow?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/FormerAct"> /u/FormerAct </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/sd1kos/having_all_the_org_images_in_an_emacs_buffer/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/sd1kos/having_all_the_org_images_in_an_emacs_buffer/">[comments]</a></span>
