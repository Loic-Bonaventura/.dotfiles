<p>The expansion includes:</p>

<p> </p>

<blockquote>
<ul>
	<li>Modular Airport Building: Connect terminals, gates, and other airport buildings via concourse networks, designing your own perfect airport.</li>
	<li>Airport Progression: The more business and tourism travel that you attract to your city the more your airport will progress, with additional building options, larger planes, and more revenue for local industry!</li>
	<li>Public transport: Sometimes the hardest part of traveling is getting to the airport itself. Connect your new travel hub to your bustling city via transport buildings like bus, metro, and train stations.</li>
	<li>Cargo Air Traffic: People aren’t the only ones traveling by air, and you need not stick your cargo terminals off in the outskirts of your city. Build new cargo terminals that fit with your airport, connect them to the complex, and eliminate eyesores while bringing in new goods for your citizens.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
