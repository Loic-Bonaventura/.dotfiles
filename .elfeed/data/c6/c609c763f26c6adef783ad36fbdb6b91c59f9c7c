<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>For me it&#39;s Cinnamon DE, Kolourpaint and Flameshot.</p> <p>Cinnamon is just a Desktop Environment made by the Linux Mint team and it&#39;s a perfect setup for me. I feel like it&#39;s not appreciated enough, unlike GNOME and KDE despite being as good as them. It&#39;s customizable enough, not so bloated, plus you can just search for GTK themes and panel applets without installing separate packages (looking at you, XFCE). And the desktop-like layout is perfect for those coming from windows, as opposed to GNOME&#39;s tablet-style/mac-style layout.</p> <p>Next up is Kolourpaint, a simple bitmap editor like MS Paint. Cmon guys, it&#39;s not like GIMP and Krita are the only graphics editors on Linux. And those two are quite complicated when all I want is to just make some scribbles and image macros or remove a background. For that kinda stuff Kolourpaint is the perfect tool. It has an intuitive bar of options, as well as quick and customizable keybinds.</p> <p>And the last one is something I use, A LOT. Flameshot is a Qt5-based screenshot tool that allows you to edit a screenshot while the screen is frozen. No need to copy into a separate editor; you can just go ahead and annotate it right in the selection. It offers cool features like arrow and pixelate, which allow you to point to or hide specific portions of the image respectively. Its lightness and rich features simply blow Ksnip, Snipping tool and other screenshot apps out of the water.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Environmental_Ad7052"> /u/Environmental_Ad7052 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/sdny03/what_software_do_you_enjoy_using_and_feel_its/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/sdny03/what_software_do_you_enjoy_using_and_feel_its/">[comments]</a></span>
