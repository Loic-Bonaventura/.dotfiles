<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I had been dual booting for a while as I had taken up doing music production stuff and Just couldn&#39;t wrap my head around how to do it in linux. Well finally just bit the bullet and decided I was going to figure it out so I wouldn&#39;t have to dual boot anymore. Got my DAW reaper running natively and found with wine and yabridge I could install and connect up my VSTs with really very little issue also my audio interface was just supported out of box. So glad that monstrosity is just over. Thanks to all the people that put their hardwork into this OS.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Odd_Confusion9053"> /u/Odd_Confusion9053 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/scxcfp/good_bye_dual_boot/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/scxcfp/good_bye_dual_boot/">[comments]</a></span>
