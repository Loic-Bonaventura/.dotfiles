<p><p>You have to appreciate the effort Techland has put into supporting Dying Light, giving it new updates and events 7 years after release and now a fresh big event is live.</p>

<p>Spike's Story: Last Call follows the events after the death of a major antagonist but there's plenty of bandits left to take care of. They're flooding Harran in a frenzy and they've hit a survivor shelter, which has resulted in many more Virals in your way. Spike has organised a safe zone but many need help getting there. It's time for you to step in and help as many as possible and for your efforts, you will get a special melee weapon â€” the Crankshaft. You're not alone this time either, as a bunch of friendly survivors in special protection suits will be around to fight with you. Sounds like a Zombie-smashing good time.</p>

<p>The event, which Techland say is only part one, runs until January 28 19:00 CET / 18:00 UTC. We <em>can't</em> show you the trailer, as YouTube decided it was age-restricted and only allows you to watch via YouTube directly - so it's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7u5ofxDJAlE" target="_blank">over there</a> if you want to see it.</p>
