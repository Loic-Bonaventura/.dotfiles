<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi pros, Question y’all might be able to help. I love using newsboys to view my news from many different sites and political bias. But one issue I have is that some or most sites only post a summary. Another issue I have is I’d like to be able to download the page to a text file and store it because why not lol. I cannot figure this out. Like is there a way for free I can get a full news post from the rss link? And how would I set it to download the page to a txt file? I can’t figure it out at all.</p> <p>Edit: I currently use W3M but am willing to try others. I’m open!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Steeler_Train"> /u/Steeler_Train </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/commandline/comments/sc6l4f/news_boat_configure_to_convert_to_txt_document/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/commandline/comments/sc6l4f/news_boat_configure_to_convert_to_txt_document/">[comments]</a></span>
