<p><p>A little flying-disc on the go when you get your shiny Steam Deck? Windjammers 2 is out from Dotemu and it's absolutely brilliant, although I am completely horrible at it. <u>Note</u>: key provided by <a href="https://daredrop.com" target="_blank">Dare Drop</a>.</p>

<p>An evolution of the 1994 Neo Geo arcade game, Windjammers 2 is a sequel decades in the making. Played with <a href="http://steamproton.com" target="_blank">Steam Play</a> Proton Experimental on Linux, the experience couldn't have been better - it was honestly just perfect. You face off in one-on-one matches that feels a bit like you're playing Air Hockey and it's absolutely just as manic. Nicely accessible too with easy to grasp controls but it's difficult!</p>

<p>I never played the original to compare notes against but I can't imagine anyone being unhappy with how this turned out.</p>

<p>While it is easy enough to pick up and play, the difficulty comes in mastering the various moves you have available. Like a fighting game, there's plenty of buttons you need to remember. We're not talking about long combinations though, it still manages to keep everything on a pretty level playing field for all involved. That's part of why I particularly liked this one. It's highly competitive, easy to get into and getting good at it will really take time but it's all perfectly streamlined.</p>

<p>Visually it's absolutely stunning too. Vibrant cartoony visuals like something out of a Saturday morning cartoon. It fits the overall theme of the game to perfection.</p>
