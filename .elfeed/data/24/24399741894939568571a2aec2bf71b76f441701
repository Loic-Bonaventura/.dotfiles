<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m using use-package to manage my packages, and running into a (technically ignorable but suspicious) behavior where, after an update, <code>list-packages</code> tells me that there&#39;s a ton of packages that aren&#39;t needed and can be removed, and to run <code>package-autoremove</code> to remove them. However, this seems to be almost all of my installed packages.</p> <p>Is this a known issue/conflict with Melpa packages/use-package/something else, or is it offering to remove the older versions, or is something messed up?</p> <p>It&#39;s not a huge issue as I can just.... not answer y to package-autoremove.... but it shouldn&#39;t be considering everything unneeded. Plus I guess it prevents me from later removing actually unneeded stuff...</p> <p>Anyone else have this issue?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Gangsir"> /u/Gangsir </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/scgeyp/packageautoremove_showing_almost_all_nonbuiltin/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/scgeyp/packageautoremove_showing_almost_all_nonbuiltin/">[comments]</a></span>
