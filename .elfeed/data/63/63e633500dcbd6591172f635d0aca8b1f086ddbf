<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I normally only write software for my personal use cases (without open source in mind). This is probably my first time actually &quot;open sourcing&quot; a pet project. I don&#39;t really have a perspective of what one must do while writing open source community facing projects as opposed to personal. Any kind of criticisms/pointers are welcome.</p> <p>project: A minimal, flexible status bar, inspired by Xmobar and DWM status bar.</p> <p><a href="https://github.com/lycuid/xdbar/">https://github.com/lycuid/xdbar/</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/lycuid"> /u/lycuid </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/commandline/comments/sccbgp/open_sourcing_a_pet_project/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/commandline/comments/sccbgp/open_sourcing_a_pet_project/">[comments]</a></span>
