<p><p>The date a great many have no doubt be waiting for, Valve has today <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675180/view/3117055056380003048" target="_blank">officially announced</a> their Steam Deck handheld will launch officially on February 25.</p>

<p>It will go by the date each user put in their reservation of course, starting off with the first lucky few who managed to dodge Valve's server issues at the time. The first batch of order invitation emails go out on February 25, and each person has just 72 hours to make the actual purchase before it moves onto the <em>next</em> person in the queue.</p>

<p>As for shipping? Valve say the first lot will go out from February 28 and they plan to send out a weekly invitation for more people to place an order. That actually sounds pretty <em>awesome</em>, so hopefully it will move along reasonably quickly, it certainly sounds like it.</p>

<p>Valve has also confirmed they're arranging for review units to go out to press sites, so keep an eye out for your favourite sites to get their own hands-on time. Additionally, before the release on February 25 we will also see some preview impressions but they didn't say who would be doing it.</p>

<p>Some very exciting times ahead.</p><div id="2Uudw9Ojp0N4cvj">Article from <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/">GamingOnLinux.com</a> taken from the RSS feed.</div></p>
