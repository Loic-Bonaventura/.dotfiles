Imagine this: somebody has broken your heart and what you want is to write your feelings in a journal without distraction. Did you get the idea? No? Neither do I. I am not heartbroken (or maybe I am and I donâ€™t want to tell you). But I would still like to show you a wonderful minimalistic open-source, note-taking application to keep journal entries. This handy little program is Jrnl and it lets you create, search and view journal entries right in the terminal.
