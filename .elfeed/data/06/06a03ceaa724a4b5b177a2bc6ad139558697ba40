<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m looking for a way to calculate how long my rsync backup takes to run. All my backups run from .sh scripts to call rsync. This backs up all my machines via ssh to external drives.</p> <p>All it needs to do is:</p> <p>store a beginning date variable and end date variable.</p> <p>Then calculate the time difference and output the variables to a text file.</p> <p>For a bash master this is pretty elementary, for this noob it&#39;s a maze.</p> <p>My thinking is that the script could serve as a function (??) that could be called by numerous scripts to get the job done.</p> <p>&#x200B;</p> <p>Many thanks</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Trex827"> /u/Trex827 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/commandline/comments/sayq9t/start_and_end_date_script/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/commandline/comments/sayq9t/start_and_end_date_script/">[comments]</a></span>
