<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi all! </p> <p>I&#39;ve started using <code>org-habit</code> this week. I can set my habits and see the nice colored consistency graph to track visually my habits.</p> <p>However, I would like to have a numeric record of this. For example, something for each habit, I am imagining something like the <a href="https://orgmode.org/manual/Breaking-Down-Tasks.html">statistics cookies</a>:</p> <pre><code>Number of repetitions done / Number of repetitions scheduled Percent of repetitions done % </code></pre> <p>Or even better, have some stats about how many repetitions I have done a habit in a row (similar to &quot;don&#39;t break the chain&quot;).</p> <p>I was wondering if it&#39;s possible to do it directly with the org-habit module or if something else is necessary. </p> <p>Thanks.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/mklsls"> /u/mklsls </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/sdfy7y/how_to_record_statistics_for_habits_with_orghabit/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/sdfy7y/how_to_record_statistics_for_habits_with_orghabit/">[comments]</a></span>
