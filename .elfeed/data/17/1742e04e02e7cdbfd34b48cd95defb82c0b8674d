<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I think I know why DT types the word &#39;clear&#39; instead of using Ctrl+l to clear the screen. </p> <p>When you do Ctrl+l, it appears to clear the screen but it really doesn&#39;t. In a GUI terminal, when you do a Ctrl+l, all that does is create blank space at the bottom of the last line. It does not clear the buffer. After a Ctrl+l you can scroll back up through all of your commands in that session. Whereas, typing &#39;clear&#39; will actually clear what is in the terminal buffer. </p> <p>Now, I don&#39;t know how much memory that saves if you&#39;re just installing a few programs or whatever but if you&#39;re doing a TON of configuration in one terminal session, that may eat up some RAM if you use Ctrl+l. For me, and probably most of us here, it&#39;s probably negligible.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Phydoux"> /u/Phydoux </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DistroTube/comments/s314bk/clear_instead_of_ctrll/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DistroTube/comments/s314bk/clear_instead_of_ctrll/">[comments]</a></span>
