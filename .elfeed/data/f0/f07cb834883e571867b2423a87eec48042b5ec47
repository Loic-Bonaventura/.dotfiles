<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>When I&#39;m in for example c-mode, lsp-mode and fly-check are automatically started, and it&#39;s necessary to turn them off with lsp-disconnect &amp; toggling (global-flycheck-mode).</p> <p>What I&#39;ve tried so far:</p> <ol> <li>c-mode-hook with lsp-disconnect, lsp-ui, global-flycheck-mode toggle</li> <li>with-eval-after-load &#39;c-mode. The same as above</li> </ol> <p>Neither work.</p> <p>lsp-disconnect is not available when I call it in my .emacs config for hooking c-mode (but it is for with-eval-after-load, although that still doesn&#39;t work).</p> <p>Global-flycheck-mode is apparently toggled on even if i turn it off by something.</p> <p>I thought, Maybe Lsp is toggling it on? I tried (setq lsp-diagnostics-provider :none) which doesn&#39;t seem to make a difference for flychek.</p> <p>Even when I disable lsp manually by lsp-disconnect for that buffer, it seems to always come back somehow and re-enable itself even while i just stay editing that single buffer.</p> <p>Anyone know how I can have these two disabled at startup but toggleable when needed?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/realfuckingdd"> /u/realfuckingdd </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/sc27o1/disabling_lspmode_flycheck_globally_unless/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/sc27o1/disabling_lspmode_flycheck_globally_unless/">[comments]</a></span>
