<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Today marks my first day taking a step into the GNU/Linux environment. After dealing with Windows and Mac my whole life, I am pleased to announce that my first ever impression is overall wonderful.</p> <p>I downloaded Ubuntu (both the Windows Subsystem for Linux to learn Bash, and an installation image for when I&#39;m ready to commit fully), and I&#39;m super happy with how it looks and feels overall. I only got a minute to play around with the GUI but it just feels like 10 year old me booting up a game; all the wonder and joy came rushing back as I booted up the USB drive and saw the black boot text. </p> <p>Everything I took a peak around the files and it reminded me a lot of what Apple does with their system. I guess if I had gone with Mint I&#39;d be getting a more Microsoft approach but I am in no way disappointed with my choice. I can&#39;t wait to get to experiment and see what happens. Maybe I&#39;ll even dump the windows installation stick and download a copy of other distros to see what happens.</p> <p>I am so glad I took the first step, and I can&#39;t wait to see what&#39;s next.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/secrets_kept_hidden"> /u/secrets_kept_hidden </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/sd0zqq/one_small_step/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/sd0zqq/one_small_step/">[comments]</a></span>
