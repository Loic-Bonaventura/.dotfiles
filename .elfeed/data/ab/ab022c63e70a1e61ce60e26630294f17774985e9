<p><p>VR rhythm game Groove Gunner from BitCutter Studios Inc will be leaving Early Access on February 10. If you own a VR kit, this is one you need to try. It will make you sweat - probably a lot.</p>

<p>Much like other rhythm games, it's all about speed and accuracy. Instead of cutting through blocks like you do in Beat Saber, you have two coloured guns which you use to shoot and each arm also has a shield that you need to block incoming projectiles with. It's very different to any other rhythm game and easily stands above some other attempts to make a VR game.</p>

<p>Combining together the need for speed, accuracy and some serious hand-eye coordination it will be a true test of your skill. It has some pretty great tunes included too and last month the developer added in features to enable custom tracksÂ  with the in-game custom song browser and editor.</p>

<p>The included music is all from independent artists. With this the developer went for what they say is a "unique approach", so rather than going with traditional licensing models the result you get is a thoroughly strange (but great) mix between pop and electronic music interspersed with metal, hip hop, rock, and more.</p>
