<p>The <strong>whois</strong> and <strong>jwhois</strong> commands allow you to retrieve a lot of information on Internet domains--likely a lot more than you might imagine. Here's how these commands work and how they can be useful.</p><p>To get started, you probably already use <strong>nslookup</strong> to check on domain names. When you do, you'll see output like this:</p><pre>$ nslookup networkworld.com
Server:         127.0.0.53
Address:        127.0.0.53#53

Non-authoritative answer:
Name:   networkworld.com
Address: 151.101.2.165
Name:   networkworld.com
Address: 151.101.66.165
Name:   networkworld.com
Address: 151.101.194.165
Name:   networkworld.com
Address: 151.101.130.165
</pre>
<p>The nslookup command queries name servers, so its output provides IP addresses for the queried domain and verifies the domain name is valid, but <strong>whois</strong> commands provide extensive details on the domain registration, domain status, responsible organizations, their locations, etc., giving you a lot more insight into domains.</p><p class="jumpTag"><a href="/article/3643632/using-whois-jwhois-on-linux.html#jump">To read this article in full, please click here</a></p></section></article>
