<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I, like some, have maintained a dual booting system so that I can play games when the mood strikes me, but I find myself booting into a Windows less and less frequently because of Steam&#39;s Proton. I&#39;ll be honest, I&#39;m flat out impressed!</p> <p>I can play games, sometimes with a better experience, with Proton than I can in Windows. Moving windows between displays is quick and easy, I&#39;m also not subject to multiple resolution changes just to exit a full screen game and I can play newer titles with ease. I find myself wondering &quot;How can I apply Proton to other stores?&quot; (Epic, GoG, etc.) and &quot;When will they start supporting linux in the same way Steam has?&quot;</p> <p>So, with this experience and the continued support from Steam, including the future support of anti-cheat software, I wanted to say &quot;Thank-You&quot;. Your effort to the community, at least from my perspective, has not gone unnoticed. I&#39;m gonna go play a flawless implementation of Dyson Sphere Program without restarting.</p> <p>Notes:</p> <ul> <li>I&#39;m not looking to start a discussion about Proton supporting non-Steam products, I know it&#39;s not feasible.</li> </ul> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/nhyatt"> /u/nhyatt </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/sbw6ha/a_personal_thankyou_to_steam/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/sbw6ha/a_personal_thankyou_to_steam/">[comments]</a></span>
