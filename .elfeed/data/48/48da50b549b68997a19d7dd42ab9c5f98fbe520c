<p>The <strong>ncdu</strong> command provides a useful and convenient way to view disk usage. The name stands for "NCurses disk usage". This means that it's based on <strong>ncurses</strong> which, like <strong>curses</strong>, is a terminal control library used on Unix/Linux systems. The curses part of each name is a pun on "cursor" or "cursor optimization" and is unrelated to the use of foul language.</p><p>You can think of <strong>ncdu</strong> as a disk usage analyzer with an <strong>ncurses</strong> interface.
