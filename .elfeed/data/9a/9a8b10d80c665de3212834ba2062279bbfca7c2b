<p><p>Seems Valve has now properly started verifying games ahead of the Steam Deck launch, with a bunch of titles now verified ready to play so let's take a look. The list can be seen on <a href="https://steamdb.info/instantsearch/?refinementList%5Boslist%5D%5B0%5D=Steam%20Deck%20Verified" target="_blank">SteamDB</a>.</p>

<p>The list is expanding, and we expect obviously a great many more to be noted as verified before the Steam Deck begins launching by the end of February.</p>

<p>It's a mixture of native Linux games and Windows builds relying on <a href="http://steamproton.com" target="_blank">Steam Play Proton</a>. Not being on the list doesn't mean they won't run, as Valve does have very specific criteria that games need to hit to be officially verified. It might be a case of text being too small on the screen stopping them, which no doubt mods will come out to help with that on some games that no longer see developer support.</p>

<p>There's a few games that are already placed into the "Playable" category like War Thunder which has too small text and the launcher being a nuisance, RimWorld needing a manual invoking of the on-screen keyboard for some text input, The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt having too small text and so on.</p>

<p>Want to check out the newer Steam store Tablet Mode? It will actually show the Deck Verified symbols and on store pages there's a whole new Steam Deck compatibility section that you can bring up like so:</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16912117091642672577gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16912117091642672577gol1.png" /></a></p>

<p>To do so it's easy enough in Firefox. Simply open a tab with the Steam store and hit CTRL+SHIFT+M. From there you need to add a new device by selecting the dropdown list that will usually say "Responsive" by default. From there hit "Edit list" and set a name of "Steam Deck" (or anything really), set user agent string to "Valve Steam Gamepad" and a resolution of "910 x 568". Then select it after saving, and refresh and you will get the Tablet Mode.</p>

<p>In other news, Valve developer Pierre-Loup Griffais confirmed on <a href="https://twitter.com/Plagman2/status/1484035893958569984" target="_blank">Twitter</a> that shipping fees are included in Steam Deck purchases which will hopefully settle a few minds about it.</p><div id="CKSXq7EP1L7_gk0">Article from <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/">GamingOnLinux.com</a> taken from the RSS feed.</div></p>
