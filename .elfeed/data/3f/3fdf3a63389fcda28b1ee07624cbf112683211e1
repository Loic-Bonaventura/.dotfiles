I like the Groovy programming language a lot. I like it because, in the end, I like Java, even though Java sometimes feels clumsy. And because I like Java so much, I don't find many other JVM languages especially attractive. Kotlin, Scala, and Clojure, for example, don't feel much like Java, pursuing their own perspectives on what makes a good programming language.
