<p><p>It's not entirely clear what dbrand has planned, however their team are clearly cooking up something with a teaser being posted on Twitter.</p>

<p>Who are dbrand? They're a company that specialises in creating custom skins, cases, screen protectors and plenty more for various hardware from phones to consoles and stuff in between - they even make face masks. They're really popular so it's not surprising to see plenty of excitement around their plans for the Steam Deck.</p>

<p>The official account simply <a href="https://twitter.com/dbrand/status/1483586665281208324" target="_blank">said</a> "making things" and included this image:</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5099562801642593572gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5099562801642593572gol1.jpg" /></a></p>

<p>That shot sure looks shiny. It is of course a render and not the real thing but it gives us a small glimpse into what they could be planning with a full custom shell and joysticks. One thing is for sure - I'm going to want a little extra protection on mine, whenever I'm able to get one.</p>

<p>In reply to someone asking if they're making skins, they replied "dream bigger".</p>

<p>What do you expect / hope to see them do for the Steam Deck? Let us know in the comments.</p><div id="Xap1KMn5Y1dL3tH">Article from <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/">GamingOnLinux.com</a> taken from the RSS feed.</div></p>
