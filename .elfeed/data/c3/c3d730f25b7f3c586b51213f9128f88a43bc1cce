<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I think there&#39;s a lot of jokes around here and on <a href="/r/linuxmemes">r/linuxmemes</a> about guiltily distro hopping, an how it&#39;s bad and stuff. While it&#39;s funny and have some truth to them, maybe there are some great merits to distro hopping? And, yes, I know. It&#39;s not that serious. I just want to write some thoughts down, and maybe somebody will find it interesting.</p> <p>Ok, hear me out. There&#39;s a time and place for it, and it&#39;s not your company&#39;s production server, and it&#39;s not your navy&#39;s missile guidance computer. That said here are a few points that might persuade you that distro hopping is a positive thing:</p> <ul> <li>Hopping can teach you a lot about linux -- Nobody is born a linux user, and everyone starts at somewhere. That somewhere is most often Ubuntu. I don&#39;t want to cast any major shade on Ubuntu, but it&#39;s not everyone&#39;s cup of tea. And that really is the point. Once you start exploring you will realize what makes each distro unique, and perhaps even a bit about how they interact with the kernel. In my own case, I had never heard of concepts like &quot;unix philosophy&quot; etc, before I started hopping around distros.</li> <li>You discover what kind of workflow suits you -- If you encounter new ideas, you might just find something that becomes part of your workflow, or taste. This is different for everybody, and browsing around is good for your future productivity/ease of use.</li> <li>The distros improve -- The more people engage with different distros, the more ideas are propagated through the community. If people try different things, it makes for a vibrant community, which is solution oriented, and are open to new approaches. This is much better than several small insular communities that don&#39;t understand each other. I run arch, btw.</li> </ul> <p>Most linux users probably eventually &quot;settle down&quot; and pick a distro which they are most comfortable with, and which they run day to day. It has happened to me, as I now run arch, btw, on most computers I own. It took me years when I hopped back and forth, to and fro, to decide what my taste is, and how I like my computer to work with me. It taught me a lot, and I&#39;m happy I did it. I do, however still try out new things (new to me) on old craptops from time to time. Maybe I&#39;ll find something I prefer, or maybe I find what I like about what I already have. It can&#39;t hurt to have an active view of the distro &quot;market&quot;.</p> <p>Perhaps we should encourage distro hopping to newbies.</p> <p>TL;DR: you find what you like.<br/> Edit:styling </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/halesnaxlors"> /u/halesnaxlors </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/sd3u9p/is_distro_hopping_good_actually/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/sd3u9p/is_distro_hopping_good_actually/">[comments]</a></span>
