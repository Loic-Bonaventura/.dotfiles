<p><p>Over the weekend it seems that Steam once again managed to break some records. Where do all these new people keep coming from? Only <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/01/there-it-is-steam-breaks-28-million-users-online/" target="_blank">two weeks or so</a> ago Steam just hit 28 million online, now it's already blasted through 29 million to hit a new high of <strong>29,201,174</strong>.</p>

<p>At that time there we 8,505,375 people actually in-game too, which is a nice bump over when the previous record hit so it's clearly not just people idling away.</p>

<p>What was popular this time with players? Mostly the usual suspects, with one newcomer being Yu-Gi-Oh:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Counter-Strike: Global Offensive</li>
	<li>Dota 2</li>
	<li>PUBG: Battlegrounds</li>
	<li>Yu-Gi-Oh! Master Duel</li>
	<li>Apex Legends</li>
	<li>Grand Theft Auto V</li>
</ul>

<p>What do we think, an easy 30 million+ online by the end of 2022? Absolutely, considering the way it's been repeatedly smashing through it wouldn't be a surprise to see it hit 35 million by end of year. When you take the Steam Deck into account, there's going to be more people playing on the go too keeping the numbers up perhaps even more.</p>

<p>It's safe to say that competition elsewhere certainly hasn't eaten much into Steam's user-base.</p><div id="C3BxQWscPm9uowA">Article from <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/">GamingOnLinux.com</a> taken from the RSS feed.</div></p>
