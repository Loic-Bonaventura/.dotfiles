<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi everyone,</p> <p>Recently took a graduate level engineering coding course despite having no experience as my research is strictly biomedical. I was wondering if someone could help me with the following command line code if I break down the assignment data.</p> <p>&#x200B;</p> <p>The data given to us is titled assignment-data. Within this folder, there are 6 sub-folders titled &quot;folder 1&quot;, &quot;folder 2&quot;, etc. Within each of those folders are various files titled 1.jpg, 2.jpg, etc.. So each of the 6 folders has different jpegs all with the same name.</p> <p>&#x200B;</p> <p>Here is the prompt: Create a directory called IMAGES. Copy all of the .jpg files from all other directories into this using a single command. Copy all the folders&#39; contents except the jpegs to another new directory, DATA_ANALYSIS</p> <p>This is my code:</p> <p>mkdir assignment-data/IMAGES</p> <p>cp assignment-data/{folder1, folder2, folder3, folder4, folder5, folder6}/*.jpg assignment-data/IMAGES</p> <p>&#x200B;</p> <p>HOWEVER, because all of the jpegs are the same name in the various folders, they overwrite themselves, and I don&#39;t get all of them copied to IMAGES. Can someone please help me with a code that renames/copies them all in a single command?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/SwampMonkey17"> /u/SwampMonkey17 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/commandline/comments/sdp5fh/command_line_assignment_help/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/commandline/comments/sdp5fh/command_line_assignment_help/">[comments]</a></span>
