<p><p>The Manjaro Linux folks have teamed up with Minisforum to bring a very small but quite mighty system with the DeskMini UM700 × Manjaro Linux. Exciting? Well, it's basically rebrand of the existing EliteMini UM700 only it has Manjaro Linux instead of Windows 10 - and the first 1,000 orders get a free copy of CrossOver Linux.</p>

<p>Interestingly enough, this is pretty much the same box that <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/11/valve-adds-documentation-for-steam-deck-development-suggests-manjaro-linux-for-now/" target="_blank">Valve showed a pictured of</a> them using in their developer documentation when talking about sorting a system for developing for Steam Deck without a Dev-Kit.</p>

<p>For a currently discounted price of $499, which they show will be $599 after, you get this:</p>

<p>What's the price like though? Well, for the base model that gives 8GB RAM and a 256GB SSD you're looking at a special launch price of $499. It shows the normal price would be $599, which is actually more expensive than the Windows version that comes with 16GB RAM ($569).</p>

<p>The version of CrossOver included is the "Linux One" package. Giving you a full license to the <em>current</em> version of Crossover Linux with <em>no</em> upgrades or help desk support. It's no longer sold by CrossOver directly, only for promotions now like this.</p>

<p>Does sound like a nice little machine overall. However, something else that's also strange is their branding. DeskMini is actually an ASRock thing, so Minisforum are being pretty cheeky here.</p>
