<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I always dreaded having to print simple file folder labels, which I need to do a lot. It would mean going to a Windows or Mac machine, spinning up the very slow Dymo label making software, getting the GUI designer right, inserting the label text, printing, and wash-rinse-repeat.</p> <p>I wrote a gem to provide a simple command-line program to print labels from a shell. As a bonus, it includes some simple elisp to provide printing the current paragraph from within an emacs buffer as a label.</p> <p>This is a bit of a hobby project, written as a Ruby gem, but it eliminated a big hassle for me.</p> <p>Here is the link: <a href="https://github.com/ddoherty03/labrat">labrat</a> or install the ruby gem labrat.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/lstrang"> /u/lstrang </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/sdaie7/labrat/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/sdaie7/labrat/">[comments]</a></span>
