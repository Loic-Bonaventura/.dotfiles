<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey folks! In 2020 I had created a configuration-based dotfiles manager called Pilgo, and while it had its benefits, it really sucked UX-wise. It was really awful to use and soon I abandoned it due to that.</p> <p>However, there were two features which I really loved from it: a nice tree view from the dotfiles and using tags to conditionally manage some specific dotfiles (mostly toggling configs between Xorg and Wayland).</p> <p>That said, I have created Park, the successor for that other dotfiles manager. It&#39;s way more easygoing than Pilgo and is more unix-friendly as well. It uses TOML files to analyze your setup, and you can have multiple setups configured in different TOML files. Take a look at the README for some examples, it&#39;s really simple to use.</p> <p><a href="https://github.com/gbrlsnchs/park">https://github.com/gbrlsnchs/park</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/gbrlsnchs"> /u/gbrlsnchs </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/commandline/comments/sb3yu4/park_a_configurationbased_dotfiles_manager/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/commandline/comments/sb3yu4/park_a_configurationbased_dotfiles_manager/">[comments]</a></span>
