<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I installed Ubuntu 20.04 server thinking that would essentially be just the OS with a terminal but I was shocked to see how much extra was there. I&#39;m on a Raspberry Pi 4b and just looking for some Docker containers and home automation apps, nothing out of the ordinary.</p> <p>I remember a video posted here about a distro that pretty much had nothing else installed but the bare OS. Anyone know what that could be?
