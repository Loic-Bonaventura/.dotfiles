<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey DT!</p> <p>I&#39;ve seen on some of your videos, that you work with python somewhat. I&#39;ve been working with Python for the past 3 years and I found the Jupyter Notebook is a great way to keep a history of interactive code that would normally be lost unless saved before exiting python.</p> <p>I&#39;ve used them to sandbox code, outline whatif scenarios and keep a separate area for testing outside the project.</p> <p>I wanted to check before I suggested this to you, it is free and open source. Thought you&#39;d like to know.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/LinuxTenderFoot"> /u/LinuxTenderFoot </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DistroTube/comments/s8o1r1/programming_suggestion/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DistroTube/comments/s8o1r1/programming_suggestion/">[comments]</a></span>
