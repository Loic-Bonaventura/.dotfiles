So much, in fact, that a famous internet rule called Poe&#8217;s Law is named after the phenomenon. To adapt, users have adopted several methods for indicating implied sarcasm such as the <code>/s</code> tag, but more recently a more obvious sarcasm indicator has appeared that involves random capitalization througout the sarcastic phrase. While this looks much more satisfying than other methods, it is a little cumbersome to type <a href="https://twitter.com/BenSommerf/status/1486143183000014851?s=20" target="_blank">unless you have this sarcasm converter for your keyboard</a>.</p>
<p>The device, built by [Ben S], is based around two Raspberry Pi Pico development boards and sits between a computer and any standard USB keyboard. The first Pi accepts the USB connection from the keyboard and reads all of the inputs before sending what it reads to the second Pi over UART. If the &#8220;SaRcAsM&#8221; button is pressed, the input text stream is converted to sarcasm by toggling the caps lock key after every keystroke.</p>
<p>For communicating in today&#8217;s online world with rapidly changing memes, a device like this is almost necessary for making sure you aren&#8217;t misunderstood on whichever popular forum you like to frequent. We don&#8217;t know how long this trend will continue, either, but until something else replaces it to more concisely communicate sarcasm we expect it to remain relevant. The build is also a reminder of the various <a href="https://hackaday.com/2019/11/17/rotary-dial-becomes-usb-keyboard/">interesting ways that microcontrollers can be programmed to act as keyboards</a>.</p>
