<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Is it possible to have folder deletions I make locally sync up to my gmail labels or do I have to manually delete them from within the gmail web client?</p> <p>I&#39;ve recently been using the `save-message` and `copy-message` commands to practice generating new folders I needed within neomutt. I removed these folders locally from my mail directory but found that each time I sync&#39;d my mail, these inboxes were still present in gmail as a label.</p> <p>I suspect the issue relates to my .mbsyncrc files `Expunge` line (or lack of), that I&#39;ve shared below. I wanted to double if I needed to amend this, or if something else is the cause - as the last time I ran the expunge command, it wiped half of my emails permanently...</p> <p>I experimented with the `Create` command in the file and found that setting it to `Master` would prevent the folders I deleted from appearing locally (which was great) but still found these were still present as a gmail label (which could get messy if I forget about it).</p> <pre><code>SyncState * IMAPAccount gmail AuthMechs LOGIN Host smtp.gmail.com User email Pass password SSLType IMAPS SSLVersions TLSv1.2 IMAPStore gmail-remote Account gmail MaildirStore gmail-local SubFolders Verbatim Path ~/.mail/gmail/ Inbox ~/.mail/gmail/Inbox Channel gmail Master :gmail-remote: Slave :gmail-local: # Exclude everything under the internal [Gmail] folder, except the interesting folders # Patterns * ![Gmail]* “[Gmail]/Sent Mail” “[Gmail]/Starred” “[Gmail]/All Mail” Patterns * Create Both SyncState * #Expunge Both </code></pre> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Guptilious"> /u/Guptilious </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/commandline/comments/schiyy/neomutt_how_to_delete_a_mailbox_folder_locally/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/commandline/comments/schiyy/neomutt_how_to_delete_a_mailbox_folder_locally/">[comments]</a></span>
