<p><p>It's actually called ---Red---Tether--> but that would look a bit odd in the headline. A new release from indie dev Sleeper Games, it's a thoroughly unique looking shoot 'em up with pretty fun looking gameplay.</p>

<p>With the help of a tether harpoon, you will take down large space fleets using an indirect combat system. Instead of firing off your phasers, you'll be hoping your harpoon is well placed to help you tear ships apart and throw them around the screen. Or, simply smash your ship into another because why not? Sounds like a blast. Check out the trailer:</p>
