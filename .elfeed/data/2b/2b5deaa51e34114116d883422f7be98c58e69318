<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;d like to start emacs in a vterm buffer. I believe I could do this by setting <code>initial-buffer-choice</code> to a function that loads vterm, but my elisp knowledge is rudimentary. </p> <p>What would that function look like?</p> <p>Any help is much appreciated.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/xwfwuerbt0o3z"> /u/xwfwuerbt0o3z </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/sckgfw/function_to_use_vterm_as_initialbufferchoice/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/sckgfw/function_to_use_vterm_as_initialbufferchoice/">[comments]</a></span>
