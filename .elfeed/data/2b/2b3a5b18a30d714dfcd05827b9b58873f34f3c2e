<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been using Doom Emacs for a few months now, and I keep finding all the amazing features it has to offer. The problem is that there are so many features that I&#39;m afraid of missing out on some of the most useful ones simply due to the sheer amount of commands available.</p> <p>For example, I had no idea that you could move text up or down a line by holding down alt and then the up or down arrow keys, or that you could navigate through paragraphs with the curly brackets. These are all incredible features that could save me hours of time.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/SteveTheGreate"> /u/SteveTheGreate </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/sd1ffa/whats_a_good_way_to_learn_the_available/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/sd1ffa/whats_a_good_way_to_learn_the_available/">[comments]</a></span>
