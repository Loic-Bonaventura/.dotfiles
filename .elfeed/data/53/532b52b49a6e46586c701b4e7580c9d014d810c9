<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi everyone,</p> <p>I would like to load a custom init file (.el) when I open a .py file. Among other things, it sets a custom theme. I think one way to go is to use an elpy-hook, but unfortunately I can&#39;t make it work. Here is my attempt:</p> <p><code>(add-hook &#39;elpy-mode-hook (load &quot;/path/to/file&quot;))</code></p> <p>Thank you a lot in advance for your help!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/wehrad"> /u/wehrad </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/sdhauz/load_custom_el_file_when_py_file_is_open/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/sdhauz/load_custom_el_file_when_py_file_is_open/">[comments]</a></span>
