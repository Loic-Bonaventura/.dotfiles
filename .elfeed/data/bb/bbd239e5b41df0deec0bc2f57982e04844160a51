<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Nvidia. I have a dual boot windows just for gaming. Gotta give props to win 11 for making my ancient hp zbook first gen handle gaming so smoothly. I run Endeavor (arch btw) as well as being very picky about the software I use (first choice being open source and privacy friendly). Can&#39;t wait for the day gaming on linux will be on par with win11. Maybe i should upgrade my setup soon, but I&#39;ll never go to windows for daily driving. What&#39;s your take?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/adialbano"> /u/adialbano </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/sct2nb/i_switched_to_linux_this_month_and_i_love_it_so/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/sct2nb/i_switched_to_linux_this_month_and_i_love_it_so/">[comments]</a></span>
