<p><p>Released all the way back in 2012, Oil Rush from Unigine is a naval strategy game and they've now decided to set it free by removing the price. Back at release, it was probably one of the most graphically demanding games available for Linux at the time, feels like it's part of our history at this point.</p>

<p>Why is it free now? Tomorrow, January 25, it's the tenth anniversary of the release. Writing about it the developers said: "It's been 10 years since the release of UNIGINE's first game. We want to pay tribute to the thing that showed the world not only what our product is capable of, but also became an evidence of our team’s abilities. Oil Rush made us acknowledge our potential, opened a lot of doors for us and showed us opportunities that we’ve been taking ever since.</p>

<p>A decade went by, we’re working on a new yet unannounced game, and it feels like there came the time to set Oil Rush free."</p>

<p>The release and early builds were back in the day when Canonical were trying to build up the Ubuntu Software Center, with it having a pre-order available there. Not only that, it was also available on Desura, one of the original indie stores that had a native Linux client before being sold off multiple times and eventually shut down.</p>
