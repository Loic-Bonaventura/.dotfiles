<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m trying to align a few equations, but when aligning on the equals with &quot;&amp;=&quot;, org-mode escapes the ampersand and exports it as &quot;\&amp;=&quot;, which makes a literal &quot;&amp;=&quot; show up in my document. How can I disable this? The only other mention of this problem I can find is an abandoned stack overflow thread, where one commenter suggests trying to start Emacs without any configurations, (<code>emacs -Q</code>) which did not solve the problem.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/representativesign03"> /u/representativesign03 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/sdk1pi/is_there_any_way_to_tell_orgmode_not_to_disable/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/sdk1pi/is_there_any_way_to_tell_orgmode_not_to_disable/">[comments]</a></span>
