<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>From looking at FSF&#39;s site, the most recent version of GNU Emacs Lisp Reference Manual is not available as a hard copy. But I&#39;d like to have a nicely bound hardback of this. Anyone have a good experience with printing such texts and having good outcomes that they could recommend? Or does anyone know if FSF actually does offer the most recent version as a hard copy?</p> <p>&#x200B;</p> <p>This is 1337 pages, so it would likely be hardback (but that&#39;s not a requirement on my part - I think some print on demand companies I&#39;ve used in the past had a requirement that anything above a certain amount of pages had to be hardback, though).</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/AnotherDevArchSecOps"> /u/AnotherDevArchSecOps </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/sdcy6m/professionally_printing_fsf_pdfs/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/sdcy6m/professionally_printing_fsf_pdfs/">[comments]</a></span>
