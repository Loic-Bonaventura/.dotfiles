<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>In the past couple of years I have had the chance to learn more cli stuff. I work in a totally unrelated industry and have no aspirations to switch so it&#39;s totally for the fun of it. </p> <p>So in this time I have started to learn about the power of the cli and &quot;get&quot; why people use it. For 20+ years I would use the terminal only in a situation where it was totally required and I had copy/paste instructions to use. Previously I had thought cli was always a distant second best alternative to GUI in a situation where nobody had yet taken the time to create a GUI. Now I am frequently in situations where I have the option of using either and pick the cli because it&#39;s better. Also the cli has expanded the basic capabilities of my computer because as everyone reading this knows, there are many things that can be done from the terminal which are basically impossible via the GUI without laboriously creating a specific application per task. </p> <p>Now I feel bad for other people because they are missing out on so much power their computer has to offer. I also see the many barriers that prevent people from accessing their computer this way and feeling comfortable. Although there are actually a bunch of newer tools that substantially enhance and facilitate this, they are not easy to find out about and sometimes I have found set up or learning curve prohibitive. and people are just afraid of the cli like I was. And on the other hand I still struggle with things that seem like I shouldn&#39;t be, because many things are designed for (and obviously by) people with significantly higher levels of expertise. And there is the fundamental problem, that there are not enough mnemonics in the cli, which I think it one of the main reasons the GUI is so much more approachable. </p> <p>I am curious</p> <ul> <li><p>if anyone else is in a similar situation to me</p></li> <li><p>is anybody thinking about extending use of terminal to less committed/knowledgeable users? or is that basically a non starter?</p></li> <li><p>have there ever been attempts to combine cli and GUI interfaces seamlessly with target audience not being coders/admins? I am constantly wishing for this because there are things I think GUI is just better for but terminal tools would be great if integrated. and I can imagine such a thing. am thinking of applications with a command palette but with a nicer interface.</p></li> </ul> <p>and just sharing my thoughts. nobody I know has any interest in this stuff.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/sprayfoamparty"> /u/sprayfoamparty </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/commandline/comments/sc9qsk/some_observations_and_qs_from_a_new_hobby_fan_of/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/commandline/comments/sc9qsk/some_observations_and_qs_from_a_new_hobby_fan_of/">[comments]</a></span>
