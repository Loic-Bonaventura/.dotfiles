<p>It is genuinely nice to see more good-looking escape room games coming to Steam. However, hopefully they've taken on some of the feedback from the first game which only had a Mostly Positive user rating. Doesn't sound particularly long either. They will have to do a fair bit to pull people from the likes of Escape Simulator, which <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/01/escape-simulator-hits-over-4m-in-gross-sales/" target="_blank">is doing very well</a>.</p>
